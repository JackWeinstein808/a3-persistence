Jack Weinstein Assignment 3
Food Delivery Log
Site: https://a3-persistence.onrender.com

The goal of this project was to take the system I made in assignment 2 and add an account system and to integreate with a database. This would allow multiple users to log data and see it from anywhere at anytime. I faced many challenges when building this, funny enough the hardest was simply getting it to deploy to a service online. I chose to use local authentication using passport as it seemed simple enough to get the job done. I chose to use Materialize as my CSS framework beacuse I like the style of Google's material design and it seemed simple to implement. I used express-session so I could track when a user is logged in.
